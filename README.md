### Shyft relay node setup
If you wish to enable travel rule protocol `Veriscope on Shyft`, follow instructions below to setup your relay node.
1. Head to [chain spec](https://github.com/ShyftNetwork/veriscope/tree/main/chains) in Veriscope github repository, or you can clone entire repository.
2. Choose your target chain name and enter that folder
    * for example, if you're using beta builds of the Sygna Hub, you should select `veriscope_testnet`
    * if you're using production builds (without beta in tag), you should select `fed_mainnet`
3. Download `shyftchainspec.json` and `static-nodes.json` to this folder
    * make sure `shyft-relay.cfg` is also in same directory, it's in the repository
4. You can now try to start shyft relay node via docker compose
    * Please be notified that syncing blockchain takes time, for example, syncing veriscope_testnet takes about 15 mins, and syncing fed_mainnet can take up to 2 hours
    * Please make sure your database mount point (`/opt/nm/db`) has at least 4GB free space
